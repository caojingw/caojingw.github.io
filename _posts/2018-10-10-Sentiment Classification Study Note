## Study Note
>> Text Mining: The process of extracting actionable insights from text.

>> Workflow:
1. Problem definition and Goals
2. Data collection and exploration
3. Text organization
4. Feature extraction
5. Classification
6. Evaluation

I am going to cover and talk about step 3 and 4.

We are given a list of text data (for example: Rotten Tomato Moview Review Comments with each polarity/sentiment score on a scale of five) 
and need to build a classifer to classfy the new review comments.

The technique will be <strong>'Bag Of Words'</strong>.


TBD
