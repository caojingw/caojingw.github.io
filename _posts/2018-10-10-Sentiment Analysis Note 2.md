## Study Note
>  Sentiment Analysis: 
To determine, from a text corpus, whether the sentiment towards any topic or product etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

>> Approaches to tackle this:

1. Data Processing
It will include the removal of stopwords, punctuations, special characters, stemming/lemmatization and etc.
The purpose is to remove any text that won't tell much information. However it is not always true for every sentiment problems.


2. Feature Extraction
When we have a collection of text corpus and in order to apply the algorithm to the text, we need to extract the mathematical representation
of these text.

One of the simplest techniques is 'Bag Of Words'(BOW).
